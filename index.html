                <p>Civ 5 is considered to be one of the best selling grand strategy games ever made. Not just due to it's IP
                    recognition, but it's detailed grand strategy mechanics. This game alone has inspired a majority of the
                    grand strategy games the past decade. This is a quick guice for beginners on how the game works.</p>

                <ol><code>
            <li>One of the first strategy games to use the hex grid pattern, instead of the traditional square grid.</li>
            <li>Still more played and beloved than Civilization 6.</li>
            <li>Introduced many new concepts that are used by other strategy games.</li>

            <article>
                <p>You first pick a country that comes with it's own leader. The leaders each have their own abilities. Some
                    abilites can be overpowered, while some are incredibly situational. An example of this is Japan's Oda
                    Nobunaga's abilty. It allows all Japanese units to fight at full power. Even if the HP is 1, it would
                    still fight as if it were still 100.</p>

            <article>
                <p>Each civilization has a unique building and or unit. They provide bonuses that other civilizations'
                    buildings and units can't. As a result, one has to strategize what Civilization to use for what victory.
                    Even then, you have to become a tactitian during gameplay; you need to actively think ahead of your
                    opponents and even during situations that are occuring.</p>

            <li>Science: Be the first to build and unite all spaceship parts to fly to Alpha Centari.

            <li>Cultural: Achieve 100% cultural influence in all civilizations.
    </li>
            <li>Diplomacy: Become World Leader in the World Congress
    </li>
            <li>Score: If none of the above victories are achieved by the year 2050 or time limit, then the player with the highest score wins.

                <p>Ancient ruins are special tiles that are critical in early game. They give a random minor boost that
                    makes a huge difference as you're starting off. However, if an enemy unit lands on them, they get the
                    bonus, so be quick.

                <p>During Early gameply, they are as much of a danger to you than enemy civilizations, because they

                <p>Although pantheons and religions aren't important for most civilizations, it can be crucial that some are
                    able to get them. There can only be 7 unique religions during a game and each country is racing to get a
                    Great Prophet before others. If they don't they'll lose their chance at a religion. However, if they do
                    get a religion, all the good bonuses may already be taken. </p>

                <p>Resource tiles are literally what they are, resource tiles. Whether the tile is a food tile or a luxary
                    tile, they each are added towards their respective calculations. Each tile carries a number of resources
                    that add to the calculations. For example, let's say you have multiple food tiles. This would be the
                    calculations:</p>
                <ul><code>
            <li>n: The number of citizens in the city</li>
    
            <li>f: Amount of food to grow to size n+1</li>

                <p>Technology is how you advance through the eras and get improved buildings, units, and improvements. You
                    technology should never be ignored, because it won't be good if your enemies are advancing their cannons
                    to you when you're still using catapults. There are also bonuses for some Civilizations when they reach
                    the next era or if they're the first ones to reach the next era.</p>

                <p>Culture is needed for a Culture Victory, but in the short run, you need it for purchasing Social
                    Policies. These policies are what gives your Civilization bonuses and can open up the oppertunity to
                    build a World Wonder.</p>
                <ul><code>
            <li>n: The number of cities in your empire</li>

            <li>p(n,k): The total cost of policy k. Depends on both the number of cities and policies already unlocked</li>
    
            <p><b>The policy cost has to be modified depending on your difficulty setting, game speed and map size. I took the numbers from a post by Yamian. Define these modifiers as:</b></p>
    
            <li>mt: The game speed modifier (3 for marathon, 1.5 for epic, 1 for normal and 0.67 for quick)</li>
    
            <li>md: The difficulty coefficient (0.5 for settler, 0.67 for chieftain, 0.85 for warlord, 1 otherwise)</li>
    
            <li>mz: The map size modifier (0.3 for normal size and below, 0.2 for large, 0.15 for huge)</li>
    
            <li>pbase(k)=mtmd(25+(6k)1.7)=mtmd(25+21.03k1.7)</li>
